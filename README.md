## Inspiration

Every web application user gives daily a vast amount of sensitive information like email addresses, credit cards, phone numbers, private messages and others. As a result, every web developer has to be aware of the contemporary threats that put all these information at risk, as well as the appropriate technologies to deal with them.

## Contents
